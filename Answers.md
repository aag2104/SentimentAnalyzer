## Answers

1. How do you train the model and how do you classify a new tweet? Give a short description of the main steps.

    > Your answer

2. How long did your code take for training and what is the time complexity of your training implementation (Big-Oh notation)? Remember that training includes reading the tweets, breaking it into words, counting, ... Explain why you get this complexity (e.g., what does `N` stand for and how do your data structures/algorithms affect the complexity).

4. How do you know that you use proper memory management? I.e., how do you know that you do not have
   a memory leak?

   > I made sure to continuously check my code for memory leaks using Valgrind. Valgrind tells me whether I have memory leaks. When sumbitting this program I, once again, checked to assure I had no memory leaks.

5. What was the most challenging part of the assignment?

   > The most challanging part of this assignment was dealing with pointers. I had a tough time working with the DSStrings. I'm not sure I had a good grasp on how pointers worked inside a program until this assignment. This project force me to overcome that weakness, despite it being a struggle.
